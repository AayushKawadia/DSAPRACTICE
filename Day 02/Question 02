#Simple Interest Logic
SI = P*R*t/100

Code- 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    float principal, rate, time, simpleInterest;

    cout << "Enter the principal amount: ";
    cin >> principal;

    cout << "Enter the rate of interest (per annum): ";
    cin >> rate;

    cout << "Enter the time (in years): ";
    cin >> time;

    // Calculate simple interest
    simpleInterest = (principal * rate * time) / 100;

    cout << "The simple interest is: " << simpleInterest << endl;
    return 0;
}

Output - 
Enter the principal amount: 50
Enter the rate of interest (per annum): 6
Enter the time (in years): 3
The simple interest is: 9
